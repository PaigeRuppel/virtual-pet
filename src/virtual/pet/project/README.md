#Bob the Virtual Pet!
*Bob has three basic needs - hunger, activity, and rest
*The menu provides directions on which commands to use for each need
*You can call the menu during the game, but this will advance time and increase Bob's needs
*You may also check on Bob's status during the game - this does not advance time or increase Bob's needs
*Bob will provide you with warning messages if any of his needs get to high 
*The warning messages will become more urgent if his needs exceed a certain threshold 
*If any of Bob's needs reach 100, Bob will die

*To exit the game at any time, type "quit"
